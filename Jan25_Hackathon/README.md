# Overflow - Hackathon Project (January 2025)

## Overview
Overflow is a modern twist on the classic Snake game. Built using **Three.js**, it renders a 3D environment where the snake collects `1`s and `0`s to form the correct 8-bit binary representation of a decimal number prompted at the top of the screen. Once the 8-bit value is complete, the player must return to the centre of the arena to score points. If the player collects more than 8 bits, they overflow and lose the game!

## Features
- **3D Gameplay with Three.js:** A unique take on the classic Snake game in a 3D environment powered by Three.js.
- **Binary Collection Mechanic:** Collect `1`s and `0`s to match the decimal target.
- **Stock Data Seeding:** Uses stock data to determine the placement of `1`s and `0`s.
- **Overflow Mechanic:** Avoid collecting more than 8 bits to prevent game over.
- **Arrow Key Controls:** Simple movement using the arrow keys.
- **Scoring System:** Complete binary numbers and return to the center to score points.

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys** - Move the snake in the desired direction.
- **X** - Changes the game to a special mode.

## How to Play
1. At the start of the game, a decimal number will be displayed at the top of the screen.
2. Move the snake to collect `1`s and `0`s to form the corresponding 8-bit binary representation.
3. Once 8 bits are collected, return to the center to score points.
4. Be careful! If you collect more than 8 bits, you will overflow and lose the game.
5. Continue playing and scoring as many points as possible!
